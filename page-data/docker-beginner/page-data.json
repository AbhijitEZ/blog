There are already other alternative\nas well like VirtualBox, VMWare and so on but docker surpress all of them. Due to its core customization over OS and functionality.\nSo important concepts related to Docker are as follow.</p>\n<h3>Container</h3>\n<p>They are the building block of docker, think of it as a virtual box completely isolated from outer where it’s job is only to do things it has\nbeen tasked with.</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>Images are the blueprint of container. Container are created from images, for eg: an object is created from class where, Image === class.</p>\n<h3>Volumes</h3>\n<p>In docker volumes stores the container data in the local machine in order to save the data even when container service is down, Most usefull\neg is DB data needs to mounted to local machine in order to keep the track of data on container stop.</p>\n<h3>Dockerfile</h3>\n<p>This is the main file which would be used to create a Docker Image. Most of the os | language | services are supported by this file.</p>\n<h3>Docker Compose</h3>\n<p>This docker compose as a controller of many containers. It can be used to connect all the container within same network, get other container\ndata and so on. Not used much in production</p>\n<h3>Inner keywords used in docker</h3>\n<h4>Publish Ports</h4>\n<p>They allow to listen the container port with outside machine <code class=\"language-text\">80:8080</code> where <strong>80</strong> is local-machine port mapped to <strong>8080</strong> of container.\nPublished ports can be accessible by external containers and services</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"docker\"><pre class=\"language-docker\"><code class=\"language-docker\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>p 80<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>8080</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Expose</h4>\n<p>Expose tell the container listens on the stated port during runtime. By default, the EXPOSE instruction does not expose the container’s ports\nto be accessible from the host. In other words, it only makes the stated ports available for inter-container interaction.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"docker\"><pre class=\"language-docker\"><code class=\"language-docker\"><span class=\"token keyword\">EXPOSE</span> 8080</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Docker for absolute beginner","date":"November 05, 2021","description":"Overview on docker, how it makes the developer life easy."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docker-postgres/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Postgres inside docker"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"dda294fe-9111-5f4b-9de7-6709e9ae754b","previousPostId":"c2417967-3532-5c1e-bfd0-ac4d15431ef4","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
